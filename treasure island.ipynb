    "Escaping Characters\n",
    "If you want to use multiple sets of quotes inside a single string, you might have to \"escape\" some of them using the backslash \\. You can see this in my first sentence: 'You're at a crossroad...'. More on escaping characters here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions\n",
    "Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case-sensitive. In other words, your code should work regardless of whether your user answers \"left\" or \"Left\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add your own ASCII art. Just remember to add three single quotes ''' at the start and at the end of your artwork to turn it into a multi-line string."
